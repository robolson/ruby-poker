== Description

Ruby-Poker handles the logic for getting the rank of a poker hand. It can also be used
to compare two or more hands to determine which hand has the highest poker value.

Card representations can be passed to the PokerHand constructor as a string or an array.
Face cards (cards ten, jack, queen, king, and ace) are created using their 
letter representation (T, J, Q, K, A).

== Examples

In this section some examples show what can be done with this class.

    hand1 = PokerHand.new("8H 9C TC JD QH")
    hand2 = PokerHand.new(["3D", "3C", "3S", "KD", "AH"])
    puts hand1                => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh (Straight)
    puts hand1.just_cards     => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh
    puts hand1.rank           => Straight
    puts hand2                => 3d 3c 3s Kd Ah (Three of a kind)
    puts hand2.rank           => Three of a kind
    puts hand1 > hand2        => true

== Duplicates

By default ruby-poker will raise an exception if you try to add the same card to a hand
twice. You can tell ruby-poker to allow duplicates by doing the following

    PokerHand.allow_duplicates = true
    
Place that line near the beginning of your program. Once allow_duplicates is set to true
_all_ poker hands will accept duplicates.

== Compatibility

Ruby-Poker is compatible with Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9.

== Background

The original version of ruby-poker was written entirely by myself (Robert Olson).
As of the 0.2.0 release ruby-poker incorporates Patrick Hurley's Texas 
Holdem code from http://rubyquiz.com/quiz24.html which I merged into ruby-poker.
